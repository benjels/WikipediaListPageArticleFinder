-i guess you will want some kind of info for what part of the html to look in when working
with general list articles looking for more links in that list article e.g.
try using a whole lot of different scopes like the ones that are given above
and handle errors gracefully because probably heaps of these lists wont contain that
html element or whatever

-you will also want some info on where to look in a leaf article to determine whether
that article is an nz article or not. probably just in the first paragraph or watev


-you will also want some stuff to ignore i guess. like definite red flags that something is not
what we are looking for

e.g. like URL suffixes that are not even for actual wikipedia articles
